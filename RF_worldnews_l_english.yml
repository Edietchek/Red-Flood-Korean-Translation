worldnews.1.d:0 "German communist Writer Bruno Apitz recently published a book called \"Lost Freedom\". In this book, the German Revolution failed due to the purge of Gustav Noske, a social democrat infamous for his support of the counterrevolution. With the help of the military and the capitalists, Noske transformed Germany into an authoritarian-militaristic state. \"Lost Freedom\" follows a young German’s struggle against his own regime supported by comrades from anarchist Iberia and Connolly’s socialist Ireland. The story hinted that USA, France and the Russian Republic are in a Pact, while Great Britain has fallen under the rule of ultranationalists due to the loss of Ireland and several colonies. In the end, the main character, together with his comrades, overthrew the regime and freed Germany. Due to the prominent role of Noske, the book was nicknamed \"Noskereich\". It received good reviews by socialist medias, claiming that it would show the horror that would be a counter-revolutionary Germany. However, all reviews, regardless of political affiliation could not help but notice that the alternative history Apitz presents is very far streched and hardly believable. The author responded to that criticism by stating that he had not intended to be fully realistic. But he also jokingly added that this could have happened in an \"Alternate Timeline\"."

worldnews.2.d:0 "Pan-Asian author, Buddhist-socialist thinker and ex-Imperial Army officer Ishiwara Kanji published his controversial new novel “To Live Another Day: The Final Battle”. The story is about the love tragedy between a Japanese soldier and a Chinese girl during the \"Final War\" between the east and west. \nThe background of the story is the most eye-catching part of the work. In China, Prince Sengge Rinchen was killed by a British rocket in the Battle of Zhangjiawan in on 18 September 1865, resulting Empress Dowager Cixi’s Xinyou Coup in November failed and the success of \"Qixiang Restoration\" that effectively turned China into an industrialized constitutional monarchy.

worldnews.3.d:0 "In the west, Southern victory in American civil war, French victory in the Franco-Prussian war and the continuation of Alexander II’s modernization efforts were the main turning points, rendered an earlier Great War between the Alliance and the Entente.\nWhen the Entente eventually achieved a pyrrhic victory, the Europe and North America was in total ruin. \nAfter the total failure of socialist revolution and the unprecedented growth of Asia in the economic crisis, the rapid rise of the yellow race brought about the uneasiness of the winning \"Great Four\": Britain, France, CSA and Russia. Britain and France tightened their grips over their colonies, while Russian turned to a reactionary theocratic monarchy. American democracy was toppled by a coalition of white supremacists and industrial magnates led by Henry Ford, creating a technocratic racist empire."

worldnews.4.d:0 "In order to curb the \"Yellow Peril\", the Big Four strengthened their alliance against China and Japan, who formed the \"Asian Mutual Aid Union in response. \nWhen the \"Final War\" between the East and West soon broke out, the entire Eurasia became the largest battlefield in history where dozens of millions of lives perished after decades of bloodshed. A variety of fictional weapons were adopted on the battlefield, including unmanned aircrafts, biochemical weapons and energy beam cannons. The title \"To Live Another Day\" refers to the last sentence of the protagonist's closest comrade before the atomic anniliation, when both sides launched their secret weapons in a desperate attempt to break the decade-long stalemate.\nThe book was criticised for radical racism and horrific descriptions of atrocities in the name of racial justice. Ishiwara responded that such catastrophe could happen in another reality, as \"they will never treat us equally no matter how successful we are, unless we stand united against their superiority.\""

news.2.t:0 "Fall of Calais"
news.2.d:0 "Recent reports have come in that the British occupied zone around Calais has fallen to French forces attacking. A combination of artillery strikes and brute force attacks pulverised the British troops. Days of fighting occured with the British slowly being pushed back from their outer zones to the very ports themselves and then eventually into the ocean itself. The death toll is in the thousands with many civilians and refugees killed in the crossfire and artillery strikes and many of the refugee camps went up into flames and refugees tried to flee with the British across the channel.\nWhile the British forces were able to evacuate mostly from Calais thanks to a combination of naval help and civilians themselves helping the evacuation, the Fall of Calais is undoubtedly a disaster for the British side losing their one and only direct connection to mainland europe and is a large success for the French. [FRA.GetLeader] visited the captured city now in rubble and called it the first strike in the war against the degenerate british race and has vowed to take the battle to the very streets of London and then Edinburgh itself. While many british chuckle at this notion, comforted by the protection of the channel a pessimistic attitude has swept over the island as bombing raids have started over England."
