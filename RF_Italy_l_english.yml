Known as the Mediterranean Standoff, this geopolitical situation has several causes; among them the Italian desire to be the most influetial nation in the Mediterranean, the British attempt to still exert it's influence there (although Egypt and Syria have achieved quite a grade of autonomy and only Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus remain firmly in British hands) and the creation of republican regimes in Spain and Greece (although Greece still has a king, but PM Eleftherios Venizelos and his party have all the power). Every Mediterranean nation wants different things which often clash with the interests of the other neighbors. This situation has also brached outside the Mediterranean, specially into the Balkans."

italy.1.desc:0 "이탈리아 왕국의 수상이자 통합민주당 좌파계의 비공식 지도자인 이바노에 보노미는 포폴로 광장으로 밀려드는 군중을 물끄러미 바라보았습니다. 그는 에스프레소를 길게 한 모금 마시고는 재빨리 앞에 있는 신문지 위로 시선을 휙 돌렸습니다. 이번 주에는 많은 정치 사설들이 있었는데, 주로 스투르초와 당 우익계에 대한 다가오는 권력 이양과 관련된 것입니다. 책을 읽으면서 그는 뚜렷한 이유도 없이 자신이 점점 불안해하는 것을 느꼈습니다. 오늘 그에게 무슨 문제가 있었을까요?\n\n그는 키지궁으로 걸어 돌아가면서 점차 이해하게 되었습니다. 많은 이탈리아인들이 거의 15년간 이탈리아 통합민주당의 통치를 받아들이고 지지하도록 만든 단어 때문이었습니다.\n\n\“민주주의\”.\n\n처음부터 그가 졸리티 또는 스투르초와 나누었던 신뢰는 그 말 때문이었습니다. 수많은 이탈리아인들을 투표소로 불러들여 신당에 투표하게 한 말이었습니다. 급진당의 별똥별과 같은 부상을 부채질하고, 사회당을 돌이킬 수 없을 정도로 분열시키고, 인민당을 요람에서 목졸라 죽인 것도 그 말이었습니다. 이제 이 말, 이 생각을 할 때마다 근질거리기 시작했고 결국 그 개념을 소중하게 여기는 사람의 양심을 찢기 시작했습니다.\n\n이것이 정말 그가 바라던 것일까요? 통합민주당은 극단주의의 공격에 맞서 만들어진 연합 전선이지만, 자유주의 정당이 가질 수 있는 최악의 결과만을 모아 만들어졌습니다. 부패, 연고주의, 이기적인 조작-- 이것이 통합민주당에서 가장 기본이 되었습니다. 그러나 더 나쁘게도, 통합민주당은 가능한 한 가장 넓은 방법으로 이탈리아 민주주의의 겉부분을 차지함으로써 정치적으로 독점을 하게 되었고, 자유를 외면하는 세계에서 이탈리아 국민들에게는 유일하게 안전한 선택이 되었습니다.\n\n그는 사무실에 있는 의자에 앉아 잠긴 서랍에서 개인 일기를 꺼냈습니다. 많은 자기 분석 후에, 그는 가장 좋아하는 펜을 들고는 다음과 같은 말을 적기 시작했습니다:"
italy.1.a:0 "우리 모두는 이탈리아 민주주의의 안전을 위해 희생을 감수해야 한다."
italy.1.b:0 "그러나 그 과정에서 우리는 가장 중요한 것을 포기해서는 안 된다."
italy.2.t:0 "1936년 경제 보고서"
italy.2.desc:0 "우리 경제개발부에서 나온 보고서가 그 충격적인 결과 때문에 우리 정부 내에서 계속 읽히고 있습니다. 경기 침체가 계속되고 있는 것은 놀랄 일이 아니지만, 이로 인한 피해는 과소평가되었던 것으로 밝혀졌습니다. 우리 산업이 고전하고 있는 상황에서 오스트리아와 발칸에 대한 높은 수입 의존도와 소규모 은행들 및 크레디토 이탈리아노의 붕괴로 인한 디플레이션으로 물가는 8% 하락했습니다. 게다가 자본재의 민간 수입으로 농업 생산이 증가하였고, 이것이 수요 감소와 맞물려 일어난 생산 과잉으로 인해 농민 빈곤이 증가했습니다. 이 보고서에서는 지난 1년 동안 실업률이 약 10%P 증가했고 GDP는 전혀 증가하지 않았으며 오히려 1% 이상 떨어졌다고 결론짓고 있습니다. 정부는 충격에 빠져 이 소식에 전혀 대처하지 못하고 있는 반면, 언론은 정부의 무능함을 드러내 시민들의 분노를 불러일으키는데 바빴습니다."

italy.5.t:0 "Before the Founders"
italy.5.d:0 "Through the silent hallways of the Palace did the men guide the King, who did not see a single soul in sight, no workers, guards, or even his family. Through the gate, they led him to an expensive, black vehicle with darkened windshields to prevent others from looking inside. Then the men drove him a few miles before they stopped in a suspicious alleyway, infront of equally-suspicious round door that seemed to lead underground. “This way” one of the men said before opening the door, and descending first. Sets of stairs later, the King found himself in an extravagant hallway, one where the sides were lined with marble statues and carvings of scenes of event in the ancient past were carved into the walls and floors. As King and his guides walked through the hall, an echoing voice began spoke. “Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto. The three brother-Gods of Rome, those who blessed the Eternal City with an Empire, as did their children and kin.” it said as the King passed by the first three statues. “Mithras, Cybele, and Serapis. Three Gods not originating from Rome, yet were assimilated into Roman culture, ones whose mysteries brought guidance to thousands.” the voice said as the King passed by possibly the 10th, 11th, and 12th statues. After another minute, the hallway ended, widening into a larger room fashioned in a similar manner. In the middle stood a collection of more robed figures, with one wearing a golden mask in the center. Behind them stood four more statues, but not ones of Gods, but rather men. “Aeneas, Romulus, Augustus, and Emmanuel II” the man with the golden mask listed off the names of the men the statues represented, “the ones who would truly shape what our people are today. Tell me Your Grace, out of these figures, which one would be your favorite?”

Corrupt politicians pull the strings that hold the nation, disregarding its health infavor of their own personal benefit. Meanwhile, those damned Futurists in Fiume and France sharpen their filthy claws, eager to pounce on us and destroy our history, our art, our very culture, yet the PDIU do nothing! Enough is enough I say, we are the descendants of our ancestors, keepers of their mysteries and inheritors of their pride, and we will not stand by while the homeland they loved be turned to ash. We are the Noble Legion of the Awakening, we are many, we are inevitable, we are the rage of the Italian people given direction. Your Grace, you are the rightful ruler of these lands, not those politicians voted into government by uneducated mobs on lies and false promises. You are what we need to bring Italy into its place into the sun, to burn the rot that has festered in Italy. We ask you to help us, to guide Italy in these dire times like the true Monarch you are. We don’t expect an answer now. Soon, we’ll take action and announce our presence to the world, whether you see us friend or foe will be decided then. Until then, think about what you believe would be best for our homeland.” With that, the robed figures exited the chamber through entryways in the side walls. The Kings two guides brought him back to the surface and returned him to the palace.
italy.6.a:0 "what a bizzare group"

italy.7.t:0 "The March on Rome"
italy.7.d:0 "It happened, the man in the golden mask wasn’t lying. King Victor Emmanuel III read the reports, all across Rome, armed men in unidentified uniforms suddenly appeared all across the city and began seizing key buildings and capturing notable government officials, caught off-guard by this sudden uprising. No one knew who these men were, nor their goals ...except the King. The King of Italy was deep in thought, deciding his next action. The Army was preparing to strike against these rebels and end the uprising as quickly as it began. Yet, doing so would ensure the PDIU remains in power in the foreseeable future, risking Italy’s total stagnation. The King had a decision to make, and he decided to:"

italy.8.t:0 "The Man Behind the Mask"
italy.8.d:0 "The Army standing down and letting the Legion seizing control of the city was a shock to most, from PDIU politicians to the army members and to the citizens of Rome herself. But the King had ordered it, and the Army complied. In less than an hour did the Legion seize total control of the city and overthrew the civilian government. Later, they appeared infront of the Quirinal Palace, requesting an audience with the King, a request granted. In the courtyard did the King meet the man in the golden mask once again, but this time without the mask. He was a rather plain man all things considered, not particularly handsome or ugly, his black hair was short and well kept and he wore a sharp black suit. In his deepest memories, Victor could vaguely recall meeting him once before. The man known as Julius Evola grinned at the King, “you have my deepest gratitude, Your Grace, this operation went even better than I expected it to. Now, together, we can truly shape Italy into what it was meant to be!”"
italy.8.a:0 "It is done"

italy.101.t:0 "News from the New Right - Evolian exodus"
italy.101.d:0 "The far-right lead by Italo Balbo and his associated right-wing front has seen a membership drop since ultra-right philosopher Julius Evola declared his intention to leave the group in an official capacity due to their participation in Parliamentary elections and lack of spiritualism noting that neither can benefit the descendants of the Roman race or more importantly its "Spirit". He is joined by his longtime Evolian followers whom are dubbed "Radical Traditionalists", anti-clerical nationalists, ultra-right veteran groups and ultramonarchists. The Balbo grouping is clearly irritated that he has left with more members than he entered in with."
italy.101.a:0 "Hopefully the Split will weaken them"

italy.102.t:0 "The Noble Legion of the Awakening"
italy.102.d:0 "The Noble Legion of the Awakening is the umbrella name for a loose grouping of militia societies devoted to the ideas of Julius Evola, receiving funds to protect nobles loyal to their cause from banditry and socialism. The perceived weakness of the King in this trying time has led to more-and-more jobless young men viewing their demands for an immediate revolution (or, as they would call it, counter-revolution) to "liberal disorder" within Italy as valid. It's speculated that their growth and ability to provide for members is also the result of funding from aligned royalists including amongst the reactionary supporters of the House of Savoy whom appreciate the loyalty seemingly pledged to them by Evola."

italy.103.t:0 "The UR Group"
italy.103.d:0 "It is rumored that Evola has expanded his high-secret society, the infamous "UR group" which according to government documents is devoted to discovering "Arcane Knowledge" and is managed by Arthur Reghini. While more practical financial backers of Evola have partially succeeded at confusing the public as to whether its existence is real or merely "syndicalist slander" members of our intelligence services have little doubt it has gained further membership from predominately the sons of aristocratic families so while the group remains small the connections it provides are quite powerful. More conservative members of our government want to find and arrest members for 'promoting indecency' while the socialists would prefer to focus on the Noble Legion of the Awakening for their part in attacking left-leaning unions. What should we do?"
italy.103.a:0 "Who says either is wrong"

italy.104.t:0 "Attempted murder of Donato Manduzio"
italy.104.d:0 "A wounded World War One veteran whom become a self-taught Italian mystic, Donato Manduzio famously converted to Judaism with a small group of Catholics after the war and bases his community out of San Nicandro. Today however a bomb was mailed to his home which destroyed his residence but thankfully went off while when he was in the backyard. It's generally agreed to be an assasination attempt by "The Sons of Hyperborea", an extreme Evolian group that has affilations with the Noble Legion of the Awakening and are said to be behind a string of terrorist attacks with this being their most dangerous one. While there is no evidence of him being directly involved and denying that he encouraged it Evola nonethless defended the attempt on Manduzio's life as defending the "Aryan Spirit" from someone whom is using his mystical abilites "in aid of the Materialistic Spirit that abetted our descension into Kali Yuga". While some anti-Semites and superstituous elements of society are in agreement with this the attack and Evola's apologism has angered the public and political class unlike the more popular vigilante attacks on syndicalists and criminals that his supporters have conducted. With even some rightists denouncing him we could move on Evola now however there are rumors the King nonetheless remains sympathetic."
italy.104.a:0 "Arrest him"
italy.104.b:0 "And the King shall intervene on his behalf" 

italy.105.t:0 "Evola goes underground!"
italy.105.d:0 "Julius Evola has gone underground, probably being protected within a stronghold of the Noble Legion of the Awakening. With the level of unrest in the air we can not afford to use valuable troops to find him until we have at least got the criminals and various political militias under control."
italy.105.a:0 "Damn"
italy.105.b:0 "At least assign investigators"

italy.106.t:0 "Evola declares March on Rome"
italy.106.d:0 "The Noble Legion of the Awakening have declared their intention to March on Naples and demand the King's supremacy be recognized, stating that the governments favoritism for foreign capitalists and socialists over the spirit of Italy has been made far too clear. Other smaller radical traditionalist groups that collaborate with the Legion to the point of arguably being regional sub-entities such as the Sicilian Warriors of Tradition and the Soldiers of the Aryan Spirit are expected to join them.

The most frequent of these victims are former labor union leaders and activists.

However more religiously fervent and morally disgusted members of the rightist coalition, including Bernardo Attolico, Carmine Senise and Luigi Rizzo have refused to pledge loyalty and simply stated that they would continue to oppose "demonic demagoguery". Together they have chosen to continue a catholic breakaway of the Lista Nationale as a separate organization that continues to ignore our society's Spiritual Revolt.

The King has reassured the people he is merely opposing the presently pseudo-Christian Vatican for weakening the state while Evola has privately done the opposite with the Legion and declared the Holy War against darkness as truly beginning. With the Camicie Nere attacking Legion garrisons, stealing supplies and launching propaganda campaigns against us we must stop them.

Nonetheless from the supplies found it is both clear they were receiving foreign funding and, more importantly, have lost too much to recover as they have been chipped away at for too long to handle a blow of this size. While not all citizens have embraced us this may mark the end of our largest internal political resistance.

However some Legionaries have rejected each of these proposals and have stated that they should be stripped clean of their riches by the state then burned to the ground to help end Papal influence in Two Siciles, an alternative Evola himself does not seem opposed to.

Much of the cause of these demands are from Evola's denunciation of monogomy for being what he views as a means for women to enslave male virility to "Eros", claiming not only that classical civilizations allowed the practice but that the domination of women was a natural way of expressing the male spirit. On a practical level it would also allow for a faster growing population of Legionaries. While the King is surprised by this turn of events he is also well aware this could keep the Nobles happy if he instituted it just for them and this would have less impact on society.

We could attempt to capture the city with the troops although we would likely lose many men in the process. Or, ironically, we could learn from the legacy of Cesare Borgia only with the Papacy on the receiving end this time and use artillery bombardment to force their surrender.

However they still encouraged Catholics to resist the regime on the way out. Nonetheless it appears both Emmanuel and Evola have triumphed over their old for." 
italy.160.a:0 "Finally!"

italy.161.t:0 "The King and The Baron" 
italy.161.d:0 "It appears as though the bond between King Emmanuel III and his High-Chancellor, Baron Julius Evola, has grown in recent months. The two hold many shared opinions on the King's powers and dignity, on culture and on the proper way of living ones life and both often unite in their hatred of the Catholic Church, liberals, socialists, politicians, progressives, democratic conservatives, Bourbons, anti-colonialists, republicans, "soft" men, insubordinate women and hedonists. Hunting trips, fishing and hiking are an increasingly common past-times for the two as they review stately material and has shifted the King into accepting even more right-wing positions than he hold before."
italy.161.a:0 "A Model Friendship"

italy.162.t:0 "The King's Passing" 
italy.162.d:0 "To the great pain of the Legion and especially to his close political ally Julius Evola, King Victor Emmanuel III has passed on due to a heart attack. He will be entombed in the capital while his son, Umberto II, takes the throne with Evola remaining his advisor."
italy.162.a:0 "Long Live Umberto II!"

italy.163.t:0 "Legion Sympathies" 
italy.163.d:0 "We have established fruitful relations with the Romanian Iron Guard, with a handful even being sent over to help us stabilize the situation. They have already agreed to our idea for a defensive alliance, something more of our advisors support as it will still allow us to be flexible in our foreign policy. Most legionaries would prefer an outright alliance led by Two-Siciles but our advisors are claiming we simply would not have the strength to fight all of our enemies between just the two of us and a defensive alliance is more practical."
italy.163.a:0 "A Defensive Alliance"
italy.163.b:0 "To hell with compromise, make an outright alliance!"

italy.164.t:0 "The Black Prince"
italy.164.d:0 "While the Papacy evacuated the Pope and bureaucrats to stay weary of the King its attempts to dissolve all of its military and navy so that it would not fall into the hands of Evola were less than successful thanks to the intervention of Junio Valerio Borghese, AKA the Black Prince. An aristocrat and ultra-rightist, Borghese was a Papal admiral whom secretely harbored strong Evolian sympathies and founded a small cell of officers whom decided that if the Papacy evacuated they would stand by Rome and, therefor, the King of Savoy. The cell volunteered to stay behind to secure the evacuation and once they had left told the military and navy they were now in the services of Two Sicilies. A true Warrior and hero, the Black Prince shall be made an admiral of repute for his loyalty despite the Catholic Church's hatred of him, whom are now doing all they can to convince the populace this "treachery" was planned in conjunction with the House of Savoy."
italy.164.a:0 "A Great Man"

italy.165.t:0 "The Black Prince"
italy.165.d:0 "While the Papacy evacuated the Pope and bureaucrats its attempts to dissolve all of its military and navy so that it would not fall into the hands of Evola were less than successful thanks to the intervention of Junio Valerio Borghese, AKA the Black Prince. An aristocrat and ultra-rightist, Borghese was a Papal admiral whom secretely harbored strong Evolian sympathies and founded a small cell of officers whom decided that if the Papacy evacuated they would stand by Rome and, therefor, the King of Savoy. When war broke out he commanded his navy to withhold attacking whenever possible and as soon as possible handed them over to Two-Sicilies rather than evacuate them as ordered. Considered by the Legion a true Warrior and hero, the Black Prince shall be made an admiral of repute for his loyalty despite the Catholic Church's hatred of him."
italy.165.a:0 "A Great Man"

italy.166.t:0 "Prominent Catholic Resistance"
italy.166.d:0 "It appears Catholic and conservative resistance to our rule has grown."
italy.166.a:0 "Modernist Death Throes"

italy.167.t:0 "Christian Resistance Damaged"
italy.167.d:0 "The Catholic resistance has taken severe blows in recent days and fewer sympathizers to their cause believe they can succeed in destroying us."
italy.167.a:0 "They will need to be instructed further"

italy.168.t:0 "The Insult"
italy.168.d:0 "Count Paolo Ignazio Maria Thaon di Revel is a high-ranking count, longtime Legion member and loyal absolute monarchist whom, unbelievably, has been insulted by a younger Legion member whom has called his competetance into question and bragged he could do his tasks far better. It appears the Count heard about this and as a known champion fencer has requested the chance the duel the young man to the first blood or, failing that, the death. There is no question the Count would win and Evola has advised the King to allow it for the King's time is too important to micromanage every petty dispute of honor among the upper-class and that duels will encourage a culture of "truth, bravery and honor". More cautious on-lookers think the King should let his Court of Advisors simply settle these types of disputes themselves when the King does not have the time or desire to manage them."
italy.168.a:0 "Allow Dueling"
italy.168.b:0 "No Duels, the council will settle it"

italy.169.t:0 "Peasants Revolt Suppressed" 
italy.169.d:0 "In the capital of Calabria, Catanzaro, some of the serfs had yet to fully accept their place in the New Order and under the inspiration of an anti-Evolian poet named Filippo De Nobili decided revolt was their best chance, hoping it would inspire others to destroy our most Noble Beings. This failed of course but due to our reputation they decided to fight to the last man and women which made it especially costly to us, with the event already being called the Pillage of Catanzaro. More pressingly however the revolt only seemed to get out of hand because local soldiers decided to retreat instead of fighting them as ordered by their legionary commanders! We will need to set a precendent to make sure this does not happen again. The most popular proposal is to revive the Roman practice of decimatio, in which all of the disobedient soldiers will draw from a lottery and the ten percent who get the "losing straws" will be beaten to death by their comrades. Less popular proposals include leaving it in the hand of the commanders of themselves at the cost of the King's authority or wiping out every coward which, while tempting, would cost us much cannon fodder in our war against socialism. Of course this will also be setting a precedent for the future." 
italy.169.a:0 "Decimatio it is"
italy.169.b:0 "Leave it up to the commanders"
italy.169.c:0 "Get rid of them all"

italy.170.t:0 "Fall of Piedmont"
italy.170.d:0 "The bastion of so-called Italian socialism is in our hands and we must finish off our ultimate enemies while we can, namely the anarchists and communists whom destroy our flesh with their weapons and (even more dangerously) the "Christian Socialists" whom seek to destroy our Spirit through their disgusting advocacy of egalitarian-pacificism." 
italy.170.a:0 "Socialism here is finished"

ITA_ride_the_tiger_desc:0 "Baron Julius Evola and his radical traditionalists have finally managed to take power within Italy after appealing to the King as a superior option in comparison to the meek liberals and the foolish New Right Front."
ITA_knights_of_the_grail:0 "Knights of the Grail"
ITA_knights_of_the_grail_desc:0 "In order to carry out our goals we will need more than loosely organized militias. The Knights of the Grail, named for adventures whom went on that ancient journey, is a highly-esteemed society made up of our most loyal militants armed with our best equipment so that they may answer directly to the Sovereign without question and cast his enemies into darkness forever."
ITA_aristocratic_funding:0 "Aristocratic Funding"
ITA_aristocratic_funding_desc:0 "While our cause was already supported by a handful of aristocratic exiles our victory should remove doubt as to our ability to come to power. We need to reach out to all worthy aristocrats and court their support in return for assuring them if their rank in our Society."
ITA_confiscate_wealth:0 "Confiscate Degenerate Wealth"
ITA_confiscate_wealth_desc:0 "There is still property and riches belonging to enemies of our order such as foreigners and gangsters that exist only to enrich these modernizing degenerates while pushing society further into chaos. Seizing these resources is not only a good but will be needed to fund the counter-revolution."
ITA_root_out_socialists:0 "End the Socialists"
ITA_root_out_socialists_desc:0 "At long last we can finish off the socialists whom desire to see man decadent, weak and pampered. In the North there remains "egalitarian" fools whom deny allowing the right for our spiritual castes to thrive in their proper place, lying to them that all are equal. They are the first enemy to be destroyed." 
ITA_integralist_complaceny:0 "Rightist Complacency"
ITA_integralist_complaceny_desc:0 "The National List are on the verge of greatness but they have stopped short by giving into traditional nationalism and desiring a corporatist economy that collaborates with capitalist powers.

ITA_a_proper_king:0 "A Real King"
ITA_a_proper_king_desc:0 "It's finally time to finally replace the liberal rule with our traditional nobles. Emmanuel III shall be given full power over the state as it was always meant to be."  
ITA_anti_clericalism:0 "Anti-Clericalism"
ITA_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "For too long the catholic priests have prevented the centralization of power under the monarch in favor of giving spiritual authority to a Papacy that preaches a modernist slave morality. While the transition out of traditional Catholicism will not be easy a good start would be anti-clericalism that cloaks the issue of the Pope's influence in just as nationalist terms than Spiritual ones."
ITA_hit_papacy:0 "End Papal Autonomy"
ITA_hit_papacy_desc:0 "The King's anti-clericalism has long been known and now with the Legion backing him he can finally demand that the Catholic Church show him proper respect by relinquishing their autonomy. Now is not the time for the meek, modernist message."
ITA_platonic_church:0 "A Platonic Church"
ITA_platonic_church_desc:0 "The Papal States armies may have fallen but the Church itself still has too much influence to do away with at the moment. However installing scriptures that adhere to Evola's interpretation of Neoplatonism and hermeticism so that Catholicism moves in the correct, or at tolerable, direction would be a goal to strive for." 
ITA_ghibelline_revival:0 "Ghibelline Revival"
ITA_ghibelline_revival_desc:0 "Against the Mercantilist Guelphs the Ghibelline understood that spiritual power should rest with the Emperor alone. Their loss helped usher in the fall of man from rule by the Nobles to Mercantilists so we must revive their legacy. This may turn the tide and as the one closest to the transcendence the King has total authority over religious law with the Papacy being grateful for what they get."
ITA_finish_the_church:0 "Finish the Papacy"
ITA_finish_the_church_desc:0 "Just as their can be no compromise with liberal modernism their can be none with the Papacy which espouses a nonsense faith that undermines our leadership and with it our very Spirit.

ITA_warrior_priests:0 "Warrior Priests"
ITA_warrior_priests_desc:0 "Spiritual leadership must be administered from somewhere, and where better then the very best soldiers of the descendants of Rome.

ITA_primordial_faith:0 "Primordial Faith"
ITA_primordial_faith_desc:0 "There is a faith for more eternal than the materialistic science and meek Christianity supported by the modernists. It allows us to achieve transcendence by understanding the traditions of our people. It is our true faith."
ITA_patriarchial_traditions:0 "Patriarchial Traditions"
ITA_patriarchial_traditions_desc:0 "While the correlation between masculinity and greatness is undeniable many of our foes insist on forms of "female equality" against all hard evidence to the contrary that this is a degeneration of society.

ITA_legionary_order:0 "Legionary Order"
ITA_legionary_order_desc:0 "It is time to establish an official political class based on the values that should that be rewarded; vitality, traditionalism, strength and loyalty.

ITA_heroic_idealism:0 "Heroic Idealism"
ITA_heroic_idealism_desc:0 "It is through heroic experiences that we not only create men but super-men whom display the best of their race and find themselves in war, until the act becomes holy itself. Death on the battlefield is nothing to fear for it is the effective overcoming of death itself. We must idealize the hero as the Romans, Spartans and Teutonic Knights did."
ITA_ascetic_values:0 "Ascetic Values"
ITA_ascetic_values_desc:0 "Modernism has chained the species to material wants, the lowest of desires. Poverty is no vice to society for it is simply another struggle that can create great men and the best of our race should not be decided by their wealth but by their spirituality and actions. Let us advocate and respect asceticism."
ITA_blood_and_spirit:0 "Blood and Spirit"
ITA_blood_and_spirit_desc:0 "We are the descendants of the Atlanteans, the Hyperboreans and the Romans making us capable of containing a race with the best of traditions and formative energies.

ITA_sardinias_final_offer:0 "Sardinia's Final Offer"
ITA_sardinias_final_offer_desc:0 "Sardinia rightfully belongs to the House of Savoy and while Amadeo's stance against the socialists is admirable it is not his place to dispute Emmanuel's claim. Despite so far seeming to view us as "extreme" he will be a given a chance to submit and join the nobility in our greater state, if not it will have to be done by bloodshed."
ITA_iron_guard_alliance:0 "Our Fellow Legion"
ITA_iron_guard_alliance_desc:0 "There is a Legion of Warriors whom have also come to reject modernity in favor of a national-mysticism that allows men to come into contact with the very soul of their race.

ITA_refuge_to_pelley:0 "Ally Pelley"
ITA_strike_consumerism:0 "Strike Consumerism"
ITA_strike_consumerism_desc: "The liberal capitalists and business owners continue to peddle consumerist and materialist nonsense to our nation, weakening their spirit in favor of hedonism.

ITA_magical_societies:0 "Occult Societies"
ITA_magical_societies_desc:0 "Despite as predicted it having lower acceptance among the masses our newly established ruling class has come to embrace Evola's religious beliefs far more comfortably than the alternatives offered by Catholicism and atheism. Occult societies will encourage brotherhood, faith and cooperation between the Order and their admirers and accelate our society toward containing at its core an esoteric soul."
ITA_constrained_science:0 "Science Constrained"
ITA_constrained_science_desc:0 "It is no surprise that the vacuous modernist values sciences study of the material world over spiritual exploration. Technology and studies that encourage decadence will end with all such remaining resources being cenralized by the state and put only towards the practical matter of fighting off the allies of decadence."

ITA_the_last_enemy_to_be_destroyed_desc:0 ""
ITA_spiritual_casteism:0 "Spiritual Casteism"
ITA_spiritual_casteism_desc:0 "At long last the King and our Warrior-Nobility have established total dominance. We must now recognize our internal races, or castes, so that each individual may live up to their full potential as they were intended to. With the slaves, serfs and merchants having to answer to the nobility and each being given the form of justice they deserve, nothing can stop us."
ITA_sovereign_beyond_state:0 "Sovereign Beyond State"
ITA_sovereign_beyond_state_desc:0 "At long last we have a sovereign whom can officially be beyond the laws of man, whose word should be the final one in all legal and spiritual matters and whom is as close to the higher powers that be than any of us can hope to be. Even our Warrior-Nobility must understand that he embodies Tradition and is to be worshipped as such."
ITA_the_west:0 "Destroy Industrial Gaul"
ITA_the_west_desc:0 "Western Europe was once the domain of the greatest empire to live followed by feudal societies that celebrated noble virtue.

ITA_restore_the_old_world:0 "The Old World"
ITA_restore_the_old_world_desc:0 "Little has been more difficult to witness than the greatness of Austria and Greece, once the bastions of the Holy Roman and Macedonian Empires respectively and in the case of the latter Sparta, being degenerated by liberalism and modernism.

ITA_the_vikings:0 "The Vikings"
ITA_the_vikings_desc:0 "Scandanavia was once the bastion of Warrior virtues, expecting its ruling class to engage in warfare and plunder. But look upon it now, an outlet of leftism and consumerism that is less than a shadow of the beauty it once was. We must right the wrongs of the present."
ITA_the_barbarians:0 "The Socialist Horde"
ITA_the_barbarians_desc:0 "The Huns had done humanity a great service in the first Great War by pushing back against the forces of modernist republicanism.

ITA_the_east:0 "Arabs and Parthians"
ITA_the_east_desc:0 "The Far East is filled with foes whom will make for great warfare, including our old foes in Iran.

Let's kill two birds with one stone."
ITA_organize_pan_europa:0 "Organize Pan Europa"
ITA_organize_pan_europa_desc:0 "Our warrior spirit has triumphed over the age of darkness as we have accomplished what others claimed was impossible and as the doubters stare on slack jawed we shall restructure Europa so the best Warriors the Aryan-Romans have may run their respective nations and destroy modernist influence while remaining loyal to the Emperor in Rome. May consumerism finally die and Europa live forever!"
ITA_take_fiume:0 "Take Fiume"
ITA_take_fiume_desc:0 "D'Annuzio's outpost in Fiume is the ultimate rebuke to our philosophy with its advocacy of progressive and industrialism above all. It's time we end the charade of respecting its existence sooner than latter."
