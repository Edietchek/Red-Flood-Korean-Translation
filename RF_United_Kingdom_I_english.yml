#BOOKMARKS#
UNITED_KINGDOM_DESC:0 "Victorious in the Great War, the United Kingdom paid the price of this victory through the slaughter of thousands of young men. Bloodied the UK prevailed and the 1920’s saw Britain prosper as the world's sole superpower, its domain unthreatened by hostile states. The 1931 General strike and assassination of the Prime Minister brought this all crashing down, culminating in the 1934 economic crash and ensuing "Great depression". The Kingdom is weak and too many the sun is setting where the empire is one of its main weaknesses. While elections have been called for March, many wonder if a new government will be enough to save the country."

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
politics_edward_viii_desc:0 "Edward VIII, King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Empire. Having come to the throne following his father George V death in november 1927 following a battle with septicemia. Under his rule Britain reached its zenith of power and then its decline from the assassination of Prime Minister Arthur Henderson, the London stock market crash and collapse of the British Raj. Edward has acted as a hindrance to the British government due to his various womanizing scandals and political sympathies for radical movements. While the government had hoped his marriage to his ex mistress Thelma Furness may have reigned him in, Edward has just continued with his old ways. Edwards reign is dependent on how much the government is willing to take from Edward and how far he pushes them."
