japan.1.t:0 "The Sunset Crash"
japan.1.d:0 "How terribly naive we were. We thought that the war on the Chinese mainland would go so easily. Just send in our best divisions, wipe up any resistance and set up some governments loyal to us on the mainland. It was supposed to be easy! The sense of victory and triumph could overwhelm the feeling of dread and anger amongst the working classes from our unfortunate economic downturn. We could continue to ride forth through China, and then Asia, as the bearers of a new order. But things fell apart; Army Group Center on the mainland could not hold. And now we are left with ashes. The people of Japan shall awaken to the sounds of complete economic devastation. Stocks have plummeted, food prices have risen even higher than before, and business are closing across the country. The Big Four are already planning for massive layoffs, and there are reports of some shareholders killing themselves. The exact reasons for the crash are obvious to those within the Emperor’s personal council; the massive investments in military industry and imperial development have left the home islands without much in the way of spending. No one could say anything, because the philosophy of Sonnō-ha was inherently militaristic, and any attempt to divert spending from the army or the navy was interpreted as anti-patriotic and cowardly. Now, it looks like they might have had a point. Japan’s future is now uncertain, to say the least. The Chinese warlords now have a serious chance at victory against our forces, which would be disastrous to say the least. The Patriotic Vanguard around Okawa Shumei will most certainly seize on this, so we will need to heavily monitor political activity within the army and the working classes, or else we will fall to communist agitation. The Emperor’s reign is now more threatened than ever, and now we must wait to see what becomes of our nation."
japan.1.a:0 "We must fight both our economy and the Chinese!"

japan.2.t:0 "Drama on the Deck"
japan.2.d:0 "It was one ordinary naval inspection aboard the 1st-class coastal defense ship Mikasa stationed at the Yokosuka Naval District, but a conflict between the military police and the sailors soon escalated to a brawl when sailor spat on the face of the inspecting naval military police and declared he, along with the sailors of the Mikasa, were going on strike, before leading an eviction of officers and inspectors back onto the port and sailing off. Since the battleship exited port, many have been analyzing the causes and the conditions of the Incident, pointed towards indifference of the officers to the horrible living conditions of the sailors on this 35-years old warship, or extreme corruption within the core lieutenants. The revolt is believed to be the accumulation of anger among the sailors and their following radicalization by the instigation of several crew members, who are now believed to be a member of the Japanese Labor Party. While one revolt is not enough to grab the attention of the nation, many other sailors in Yokosuka are already rising up against their commanders and seizing control of the vessel. Within hours, sailors and dock workers secured the naval base, followed by riots in factories throughout the greater Kanto region later the day. The rebels declared the Provisional People’s Council of Japan, and proceeded to march north into Tokyo. Caught off guard as the bulk of the Army is on Chinese front, the Imperial Army hastily ordered the Imperial Guard and the garrisons in Tokyo to crush the rebellion. However, a significant portion of the loyalist forces refused to follow orders due to the control of young officers sympathetic of communism. Being bombarded by battleships from Yokosuka, which had been proclaimed the base of operations of the newly formed Japanese People’s Navy, the loyalists were overwhelmed by socialist completely within a few hours. The revolutionaries met up in the industrial port of Yokohama where officers and local union leaders joined together. The Japanese revolution begins!"
japan.2.a:0 "Fight to eradicate the communist threat!"
japan.2.b:0 "It is too late for you, capitalists! (Switch to Revolutionary Japan)"

japan.201.t:0 "Loyalist Victory"

japan.201.a:0 "Long Live The Emperor"

japan.202.t:0 "Revolutionary Victory"
japan.202.d:0 "The Communist Forces having taken the edge over Imperial loyalists, have managed to capture the key cities and destroy or win over the soldiers of the Imperial Army and Navy. The Emperor and Royal Family have fled to Korea and the Royal institutions have been seized by People's Councils. The war is over and the Empire has fallen at long last!"
japan.202.a:0 "Long Live The Revolution"

japan.3.t:0 "Peace of Beijing"
japan.3.d:0 "Japan offers us terms in their time of crisis. We need time to recover our forces and resist them, sign the peace and we will prepare our vengeance."

japan.401.t:0 "Shanxi Refuses"
japan.401.d:0 "The Shanxi leadership has refused to even entertain our offer of peace, the envoy reports he was spat at by officers before he was even able to deliver the terms to the Government."
japan.401.a:0 "Those fools, ready the guns!"

japan.5.t:0 "The Fate of the New Japan"
japan.5.d:0 "The revolution has brought not just a battle between the old monarchist order and the new radical one, but a struggle between fellow revolutionaries. Shumei Okawa has been a strong proponent of a powerful leadership able to crush all dissent and opposition, and his Patriotic Vanguard has been the shock troops of our army during the revolution. He has faced fierce opposition, however, from Hitoshi Yamakawa, a libertarian Marxist and advocate of democratic institutions. He has consistently accused Shumei of trying to subvert the democratic will of the people and assert his own violent ideology on Japan. In a way, he was right. Yamakawa was meeting with other government officials today when he heard gunshots outside the capitol building. When he looked outside, he saw members of the Patriotic Vanguard shooting at Red Army soldiers. Shumei had declared the current regime counterrevolutionary and restorationist, and had called upon the Vanguard to overthrow Yamakawa and form a new government. Yamakawa saw Shumei himself walk forward, ordering the troops forward and singing songs in dedication to the socialist fatherland. He seemed not to care that bullets where whizzing past him. They quickly pushed to the door of the building, and were greeted with more soldiers. They…"
japan.5.a:0 "Were gunned down quickly, and Shumei and his men stormed the building."
japan.5.b:0 "Repelled the Vanguard, and shot Shumei during the shootout."

japan.7.d:0 "The Japanese are offering the Ma Clique a stake in the war against Yan Xishan and the Shanxi. It is a risky move to march East with the more volatile regimes to our North stirring. Still, an opportunity is an opportunity."
japan.7.a:0 "Very well, we accept"
japan.7.b:0 "Never!"

japan.8.t:0 "Ma Clique Accepts"
japan.8.d:0 "The Ma Clique now marches to war on the western flank of the Shanxi. This should relieve our belegeured men and make the war progress that bit faster. The dreams the Generals had of a Three Month Campaign might just come true."
japan.8.a:0 "Excellent!"

japan.9.t:0 "Ma Clique Declines"
japan.9.d:0 "The Ma Clique has refused to get involved in our war. The cowards have shyed away from the opportunity to topple the Shanxi and take a slice of the spoils for themselves. The warlords are clearly too attatched to their existing power to make a move on one-another."
japan.9.a:0 "Curse Them!"

japan.10.t:0 "Korean Referendum"
japan.10.d:0 "Korea must be reintegrated to the Empire, permanently. A rigged ballot ought to suffice, the Governors will keep their places and simply take orders directly from Tokyo instead. Any civilian unrest can quickly be squashed by the military and our integration of Korea will make more loyal subjects of them in the long run."
japan.10.a:0 "Rig the Ballot."

japan.11.t:0 "Restoration of the Shogunate of Japan"
japan.11.d:0 "The Restorationists didn't go far enough. The true way to glory for Japan was always to return power to the Shogun. The Emperor rules from the Palace and the Shogun rules from the hand of a sword."
japan.11.a:0 "The Shogunate is Back"

japan.12.t:0 "Colonial Management Re-Organised"
japan.12.d:0 "The Revolution cannot simply remain in Japan. Our Comrades in China have already picked up the banner but the former territorial gains of the Japanese Empire remain capitalist and reactionary. They should be toppled and have more appropriate leaders installed."
japan.12.a:0 "Revolutionary Guidance at its Finest"

japan.13.t:0 "Abolition of the Zaibatsus"
japan.13.d:0 "The Big Four have dominated not just the Japanese economy but the politics as well for far too long. The monopolie smust be outlawed and the assets of the companies redistributed to the worker councils."
japan.13.a:0 "The Stain is Scrubbed Out"

japan.14.t:0 "Champion's Day"
japan.14.d:0 "On this day we mark the Victory of the Revolution against the Emperor, against the tyranny, repression and capitalist system that had kept the people of Japan on their knees for centuries. The Red Banners fly high in the wind and songs of Comradeship in face of death are sung at public parades around the country. Efigies of the Emperor are burned, the names of the fallen comrades revered, The Trimuph of the Revolution is theirs in memoriam."
japan.14.a:0 "Heroes All."

japan.15.t:0 "Indochina demands border regions"
japan.15.d:0 "The Japanese puppets in Hanoi have listed their demands for our border territories in the North and South. Laos and Cambodia suffered terribly under French rule and the Japanese are likely no different. The risk of a military provocation is very high however and Siam may not be able to weather the storm..."
japan.15.a:0 "We Will Not Be Swayed."
japan.15.b:0 "These Japanese Stooges Will Pay."

japan.151.t:0 "Siam Conceeds"
japan.151.d:0 "The Siamese Government has decided to cede Laos and Cambodia to our Indochinese Subject. A wise choice. That's one less concern for the General Staff."
japan.151.a:0 "Naturally"

japan.152.t:0 "Siam Resists Japanese Pressure"
japan.152.d:0 "The Siamese Government has decided not to cede Laos and Cambodia. The General Staff are commenting it was pointless to ask in the first place and we have wasted the element of surprise by asking them first."
japan.152.a:0 "Curse Them!"

japan.16.t:0 "Lotus Act"
japan.16.d:0 "The corruption in the Big Four is purged and the Japanese economic outlook is stronger for it."
japan.16.a:0 "The Flower Blooms"

japan.17.t:0 "Investigation of the Zaibatsus"
japan.17.d:0 "What started out as an audit into potential wartime miscalculations has spiralled out of control and now a full blown investigation has started. It turns out the guilty memebers of the Big Four are more numerous and the charges much more severe, some are on trial now for treason!"
japan.17.a:0 "The Guilty Parties Will Suffer."

japan.18.t:0 "Crackdown"
japan.18.d:0 "The corruption scandal sweeps the country and some who supported the Emperor against the Communists are beginning to second guess themselves. A widespread crackdown on the Zaibatsus and their leaders is necessary for stability."
japan.18.a:0 "They Are Not Untouchable."

japan.19.t:0 "Japanese Empire Re-Born"
japan.19.d:0 "Our ambitions will not be scuppered this time! The Japanese Empire stands as the rightful master of the East!"
japan.19.a:0 "Restored at Last"

japan.20.t:0 "Divine Wind Coup"
japan.20.d:0 "The failures of this government in stopping both the Chinese menace on the mainland and the communist threat at home has made clear the fact that things need to change immediately. Yasuhito is an honourable and good man, but he is no longer needed anymore. No, what is needed is a firm hand an a recommitment to imperialism. That means a change in management; a new Emperor, in other words. Prince Nobuhito has agreed to support this coup, but will not be anywhere near Japan for the time being in case things go south. As we speak, soldiers loyal to us have stormed the royal palace and are starting to build defenses in case of counterattack. The defense was heavy, with some of the most fanatical loyalists of the Emperor standing guard. Our soldiers were able to blast through their fortifications with explosives, but with a lot of casualties on both sides. Police officers loyal to the Prince have also been working around the clock to preserve order and ensure that rioting and civil unrest is kept at a minimum; we can’t allow the enemies of Japan any chances to destroy our nation, be it without or within. Now, all we have to do is hold out and wait for Nobuhito to come to Kyoto. Yasuhito has been surprisingly cooperative; he isn’t happy with the situation, but he hasn’t been doing anything to resist either. In the meantime, we shall hold on to the last man, for in these desperate times, everything must be done for the sake of the Emperor and the nation."
japan.20.a:0 "Revere the Emperor, destroy the traitors!"

japan.203.t:0 "Invite Nobuhito to Kyoto"
japan.203.d:0 "At long last, Nobuhito has returned to the country. Hiding outside of the country since the Divine Wind Coup, he has returned triumphant and proud in the efforts of the soldiers and their officers in bringing about a better government. An agenda more focused on empire building and defeating the Chinese is now on the table. It wasn’t particularly difficult to convince Yasuhito to abdicate. He had been cooperative during the coup itself, wanting to ensure that as little harm and chaos is brought to Japan as possible. At first, however, he wasn’t willing to give up the title of Emperor; he insisted that the people loved him and that his government was about to fix things in just a matter of days. He was persuaded, however, when it was argued that the people wanted him safe and secure, and that Nobuhito would essentially be his puppet and listen to his every word. Hearing this, Yasuhito agreed to abdicate, and in his place, Emperor Nobuhito has taken the throne. These chaotic times may finally be coming to an end with the ascension of a new Emperor. Committed to expanding the empire and destroying communism, he and the new government has won the support of the army and the navy, and will be working towards a renewed imperialism."
japan.203.a:0 "Long live the Emperor!"

japan.21.t:0 "Peace of Beijing"
japan.21.d:0 "The war in China has left our forces battered and in disarray, with our side barely gaining much of any ground against the warlords. Furthermore, the total economic crash we’ve been dealing with is doing us no favors; dissent is growing at home, and soldiers are having a harder and harder time getting the supplies they need to fight. Only the delusional fail to recognize that this needs to end. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t end this to favor us. The proposal known as the Beijing Compromise, would annex territory up to and including Beijing, giving us a solid base on the Chinese mainland. It also ends the war and gives the warlords the illusion of victory. A win-win! Of course, not everyone is happy with this. The military is still under the belief that they can win this in no time at all, as if the last couple months haven’t proven otherwise. Although total victory over the warlords is alluring, as far away as it is.."
japan.21.a:0 "Send the demands."
japan.21.b:0 "We Don't Stop Until They're Dead."

japan.211.t:0 "A Peace Offer From Japan"
japan.211.d:0 "The war has clearly not gone in Japan’s favour. Our brave troops have been able to hold the line and repel attack after attack, and now the Japanese are experiencing the consequences of their actions. An offer has come forward from the Japanese government offering control of everything up to and including Beijing in return for ending our war. A tempting offer, for sure, for the war has been brutal. Some generals are quite confident in pushing them off the mainland entirely, however, and are hostile to this idea."
japan.211.a:0 "We Accept! Victory is Ours!"
